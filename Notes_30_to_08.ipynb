Data is labeled to tell the machine what patterns (similar words and images, data categories, etc.) it should be looking for and recognize connections with.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, if you want to automatically detect spam, you would need to feed a machine learning algorithm examples of emails that you want classified as spam and others that are important, and should not be considered spam.\n",

In this case, models are fed input data but the desired outcomes are unknown, so they have to make inferences based on circumstantial evidence, without any guidance or training. The models are not trained with the “right answer,” so they must find patterns on their own.\n",

This method is mostly used for exploratory analysis and can help you detect hidden patterns or trends.

Given a set of income and spending data, a machine learning model can identify groups of customers with similar behaviors.\n",

In short, reinforced machine learning models attempt to determine the best possible path they should take in a given situation. They do this through trial and error. Since there is no training data, machines learn from their own mistakes and choose the actions that lead to the best solution or maximum reward.\n",

If it’s not performing accurately, you’ll need to keep training.

        "\n",
        "**1. Binary Classification:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The most basic and commonly used form of classification is a binary classification. Here, the dependent variable comprises two exclusive categories that are denoted through 1 and 0, hence the term Binary Classification. Often 1 means True and 0 means False. For example, if the business problem is whether the bank member was able to repay the loan and we have a feature/variable that says “Loan Defaulter,” then the response will either be 1 (which would mean True, i.e., Loan defaulter) or 0 (which would mean False, i.e., Non-Loan Defaulter). This classification has often formed the basis of various classification algorithms and is the kind of classification technique that is foremost understood.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Binomial Classification:**\n",
        "\n",
        "This classification type is technically like Binary Classification only as the Y variable comprises two categories. However, these categories may not be in the form of True and False. For example, if we have a dataset for multiple features that denote pixel density, we have a Y variable with two categories – “Car” or “Bike,” This type of classification is known as Binomial Classification. From a practical point of view, especially as far as Machine Learning is concerned, there is no difference as these two categories can also be encoded and denoted as 0 and 1, making this type look like a Binary Classification only.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Multi-class Classification:**\n",
        "\n",
        "An advanced form of classification, multi-class classification, is when the Y variable is comprised of more than two classes/categories.  Here each observation belongs to a class, and a classification algorithm has to establish the relationship between the input variables and them. Therefore, during prediction, each observation is assigned to a single exclusive class. For example, a business problem where there is a need to categorize whether an observation is “Safe,” “At-Risk,” or “Unsafe” then would be classed as a multi-class classification problem. Note – Each observation can belong to only one class, and multiple classes can’t be assigned to observation. Thus here, observation will either be “Safe” or “At-Risk” or “Unsafe” and can’t be multiple things.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Multi-label Classification:**\n",
        "\n",
        "This form of classification is similar to Multi-class classification. Here, the dependent variable has more than 2 categories; however, it is different from multi-class classification because here, an observation can be mapped to more than one category. Therefore, the classification algorithm here has to understand which classes an observation can be related to and understand the patterns accordingly. A common use-case of these types of classification problem is found in text mining related classification where an observation (e.g., text from a newspaper article) can have multiple categories in its corresponding dependent variable (such as “Politics,” “Name of Politicians Involved,” “Important Geographical Location” etc..).Thus, a classification can be of multiple types, and depending upon the business problem. We have to identify the kind of classification technique and the algorithms involved in such techniques."
