This is known as overfitting or high variance.\n",
        "\n",
        "One popular technique to control overfitting is  regularization, which involves the addition of a  penalty term to the error or loss function to discourage the coefficients from reaching large values. Regularization, in simple terms, is a penalty mechanism that applies shrinkage to model parameters (driving them closer to zero) in order to build a model with higher prediction accuracy and interpretation. Regularized regression has two advantages over linear regression:\n",

        "The performance of the model working better on the testing data suggests that the model is trying to generalize from training data. A model with too many parameters might try to fit noise specific to the training data. By shrinking or setting some coefficients to zero, we trade off the ability to fit complex models (higher bias) for a more generalizable model (lower variance).\n",

The larger the value of λ , the more features are shrunk to zero. This can eliminate some features entirely and give us a subset of predictors, reducing model complexity. So Lasso regression not only helps in reducing overfitting, but also can help in feature selection. Predictors not shrunk toward zero signify that they are important, and thus L1 regularization allows for feature selection (sparse selection). The regularization parameter ( λ ) can be controlled, and a lambda value of zero produces the basic linear regression equation.\n",

Therefore, ridge regression decreases the complexity of a model but does not reduce the number of variables; it just shrinks their effect. When λ is closer to zero, the cost function becomes similar to the linear regression cost function.

We need to manually input missing values and remove outliers. Also, feature scaling (standardization and normalization) is required before applying the KNN algorithm to any dataset; otherwise, KNN may generate wrong predictions."

        "In the previous section, we discussed grid search as a way to find the right hyperparameter to achieve better performance. In this section, we will expand on that process by discussing the key components of evaluating the model performance, which are overfitting, cross validation, and evaluation metrics.\n",

        "Overfitting and Underfitting\n",
        "A common problem in machine learning is  overfitting, which is defined by learning a function that perfectly explains the training data that the model learned from but doesn’t generalize well to unseen test data. Overfitting happens when a model overlearns from the training data to the point that it starts picking up idiosyncrasies that aren’t representative of patterns in the real world. This becomes especially problematic as we make our models increasingly more complex.  Underfitting is a related issue in which the model is not complex enough to capture the underlying trend in the data.  [Figure 5](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/machine-learning-and/9781492073048/ch04.html)  illustrates overfitting and underfitting. The left-hand panel of  [Figure 5](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/machine-learning-and/9781492073048/ch04.html)  shows a linear regression model; a straight line clearly underfits the true function. The middle panel shows that a high degree polynomial approximates the true relationship reasonably well. On the other hand, a polynomial of a very high degree fits the small sample almost perfectly, and performs best on the training data, but this doesn’t generalize, and it would do a horrible job at explaining a new data point.\n",
        "\n",
        "The concepts of overfitting and underfitting are closely linked to  bias-variance trade-off.  Bias refers to the error due to overly simplistic assumptions or faulty assumptions in the learning algorithm. Bias results in underfitting of the data, as shown in the left-hand panel of  [Figure 5](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/machine-learning-and/9781492073048/ch04.html) . A high bias means our learning algorithm is missing important trends among the features.  Variance refers to the error due to an overly complex model that tries to fit the training data as closely as possible. In high variance cases, the model’s predicted values are extremely close to the actual values from the training set. High variance gives rise to overfitting, as shown in the right-hand panel of  [Figure 5](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/machine-learning-and/9781492073048/ch04.html) .

        "#Cross Validation\n",
        "One of the challenges of machine learning is training models that are able to generalize well to unseen data (overfitting versus underfitting or a bias-variance trade-off). The main idea behind  cross validation is to split the data one time or several times so that each split is used once as a validation set and the remainder is used as a training set: part of the data (the training sample) is used to train the algorithm, and the remaining part (the validation sample) is used for estimating the risk of the algorithm. Cross validation allows us to obtain reliable estimates of the model’s generalization error. It is easiest to understand it with an example. When doing  k-fold cross validation, we randomly split the training data into  k folds. Then we train the model using  k-1 folds and evaluate the performance on the  kth fold. We repeat this process  k times and average the resulting scores.\n",

        "Area under ROC curve (AUC) is an evaluation metric for binary classification problems. ROC is a probability curve, and AUC represents degree or measure of separability. It tells how much the model is capable of distinguishing between classes. The higher the AUC, the better the model is at predicting zeros as zeros and ones as ones. An AUC of  0.5 means that the model has no class separation capacity whatsoever. The probabilistic interpretation of the AUC score is that if you randomly choose a positive case and a negative case, the probability that the positive case outranks the negative case according to the classifier is given by the AUC.\n",

There are several factors that can affect your choice of a machine learning model. The main criteria in most of the cases is the model performance that we discussed in the previous section. However, there are many other factors to consider while performing model selection. In the following section, we will go over all such factors, followed by a discussion of model trade-offs.\n",

Suppose a machine learning algorithm is used to accept or reject an individual’s credit card application. If the applicant is rejected and decides to file a complaint or take legal action, the financial institution will need to explain how that decision was made. While that can be nearly impossible for ANN, it’s relatively straightforward for decision tree–based models.\n",
